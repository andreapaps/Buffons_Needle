# Buffons_Needle

"In mathematics, Buffon's needle problem is a question first posed in the 18th century by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon:

Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?" (for more info on the problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem )

This code answers the question using random numbers and a simulation.

We also fix the length of the needle and the width of the floorboards, then use or simulation
to estimate the value of pi.

Along with the problem there is a plot of what goes on in a single trial as well as checking
if we could generate random points that lie on a circle, as we needed this for our fixed width and length
section of the code.
